Quick notice for myself and the world. If you want to debug Kotlin native, make sure - for the moment - you have the 'Jump to line' plugin (from JetBrains) disabled.
It will break the debugging feature. You can [track the issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-55437/Debugging-native-kotlin-not-possible), if you like.
