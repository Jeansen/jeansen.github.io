Some time back, in 2016, I started a little project written in Perl as an extension to my beloved terminal emulator  [urxvt](https://github.com/exg/rxvt-unicode),
During development I found a nasty memory leak. I posted my findings on the IRC channel where is got picked up quickly and a patch was provided soon after.
Unfortunately, it took more than 4 years until a new release was created. But, finally, in Mai 2021 [a new release 9.25](http://dist.schmorp.de/rxvt-unicode/Changes) appeared including this patch. Yay!

Since then a couple more releases were created and we are now at version 9.30. I am looking forward to doing work on my older project, again. Hopefully, it will 
be soon. In the meantime, check out the [cdmn](https://github.com/Jeansen/cdmn) project!
