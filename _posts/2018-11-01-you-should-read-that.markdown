Sometimes I find something that I read once and come back later on but that I know will be hard to find again. So, here is a list of articles, blog posts, wiki pages and so on that I think of as "nuggets of the internet". They might fall into all sorts of categories. Have fun!

- [Wherefore Art, Thou?](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2070) : Larry Wall's view on Perl and other languages compared to different music genres.
