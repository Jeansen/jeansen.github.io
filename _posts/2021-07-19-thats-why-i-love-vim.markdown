Yes, I am not only using a full-blown IDE. Especially when it comes to Perl, Bash or Python scripts, I do prefer the terminal and VIM! I would not say, I am a hard-core VIM user. I do love to have some nice plug-ins at my hand and have VIM behave similar to an IDE while keeping things lean.

That's why then and when I also - in addition to some bug findings - open suggestions in the VIM community. And, even if it is only a cosmetic suggestion (which no hard-core user ever needs), the good folks at [https://github.com/vim/vim/](https://github.com/vim/vim/) listen, ask, state their opinion and eventually provide a patch. 

That's all I have to write and say for today. Just sharing my honest and humble gratitude even for small things like a [customizable column indicator for folds](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/5115) ;-)
