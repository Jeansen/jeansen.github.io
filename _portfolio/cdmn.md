Back in June 2016 I started a little Perl project that in its initial idea should be a simple extension for the terminal 
emulator [urxvt](https://github.com/exg/rxvt-unicode), just showing some indicators of how much my cpu, disk or ram is
utilized.

Well, what should I say. It grew and became a lot more. If you want to know more, just check out the [project page on github](https://github.com/Jeansen/cdmn).
